Pre-Requisites:

- Any recent distro of Linux should work, the init script that works is only the debian/ubuntu one though.

- Wanpipe for Linux (wiki.sangoma.com) 
  (Install in TDM API mode, wanrouter start wanpipex should create /dev/wpxxx or /dev/wanpipexxxx and not /dev/zap/xx or /dev/dahdi/xxx)

- libpri, the tested version is included in the libpri/ directory, I recommend using that one, don't cry if you run into troubles otherwise.

- sqlite3 (any version)

SBridge installation

1. Run the usual ./configure && make && make install

2. Run the sbridge.install.sh script ( or make a patch for Makefile.am and send me that!) 

3. Read the sbridge.conf file for comments on how to configure it
