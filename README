SBridge is a project created by Regulus Labs for their modem pool product.

This is a simple audio/data bridge between Sangoma telephony devices in PRI links and the TCP network.

TCP Server <-----> SBridge <-----> PRI Link (ie PSTN)
All raw data read from the PSTN is sent to the TCP server, whether is voice or data, and viceversa. Currently SBridge supports voice and V.110 calls only.

There is some initial V.32 code but was never finished, feel free to complete it :-)

There is no much plans for expansion now, but if you have a feature request, does not hurt to ask.
